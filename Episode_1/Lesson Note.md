# Introduction to programming with C
## Primitives
* Source code --> complier --> machine code (0s and 1s). 
* a command line interface(cli) is much prefer due to writing can sometime faster than point and click
* some CLI jargon for making a file:
* $ code hello.c #create a file hello.c on the server
* $ make hello #make a compiled machine code from the hello file
* $ ./hello #run the hello compiled program that we made
* notice that the “ ./ “ means “at the file path”
* ‘stdio.h’ is a library where the functions exist, in c-language is called header files
* argument—> function —> returns value
* In C, it is important to tell the complier the type of variable it is going to use
* assignment a variable, we use ‘=’
* ‘%s’ means plugin string value here in C
